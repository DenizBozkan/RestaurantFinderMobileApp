My term project is a restaurant finding application. The application starts with a login screen. 
If you have forgotten your password, you can click on the "Forgot Password" text just above the 
"Login" button to reset your password. If you are a first-time user and want to create an account,
you can click on the "Sign Up" text right below it to proceed to the registration page. On this
page, you need to enter your username, email address, and password. If you enter an incorrect 
email address or if the email address you entered is already in use by another user, the system 
will provide you with an informative message. Similarly, if your password is less than 6 characters 
or if the password entered in the confirmation field does not match, the system will notify you. 
Once you meet the necessary conditions and click the "Sign Up" button, you will be redirected back 
to the login page. After successfully logging in, you will be presented with the main page. On this
page, you can see different types of restaurants and recently popular spots. The tab at the bottom
of the screen, specifically the one in the middle, lists your previously favorited places, while the
rightmost tab is the search tab. From there, you can search for any restaurant you desire. When you
find the restaurant you are looking for and click on it, you can view the ratings given by users,
as well as the restaurant's photos and menu. If you like the restaurant, you can double-click on 
the top image of the restaurant or click on the heart button on the left side of the rating section 
to add the restaurant to your favorites.
